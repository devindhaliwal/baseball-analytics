# Baseball Analytics

Developed a linear regression machine learning model to predict how many games an MLB team would win based on team statistics with over 90% accuracy. User can enter custom statistics to get predictions for the number of wins, enter specific statistics to visualize its impact on the number of wins, and enter a certain statistic to visualize its impact on a specific team's wins over time. Used Python, scikit learn, pandas, and seaborn.
