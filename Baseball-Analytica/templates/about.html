<h1>Who Even Made This?</h1>
<img src="/static/article_imgs/devin_nathan.JPG" alt="" width="25%" height="350">
</center>
<br>
<p> Devin Dhaliwal and Nathan Ackerman are rising Juniors at the University of Southern California from the Bay Area. They are avid baseball fans and played high school baseball together at the division 5 powerhouse of The Athenian School. Devin is majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration while Nathan is a Journalism major with minors in Sports Media and Applied Analytics.</p>

<p>The idea for this website came about one day when having an argument about the relevancy of certain stats and their impact on helping a team win. With no way to easily demonstrate their arguments (other than boring tables) they decided there had to be a better way. Devin works on the back-end and front-end software development while Nathan works on writing articles.</p>

<p>Outside of school and being dissapointed by USC football, Devin is a trumpet player in the Trojan Marching Band and an All-American intramural flag football wide reciever. Additionally, Nathan is the Managing Editor of the Daily Trojan and huge Phillies fan. One day, Nathan strives to be a baseball analyst at ESPN and Devin a product manager at a tech company.</p>
